F2EParser
=========

Parser for exporting animation from flash (xml from grapefrukt exporter) to your game engine.

For now I've just made a class for cocos2d (F2ECocos2d).

Usage - just open test project and look into code it's quite simple.

It looks for files Sc01_Anim.xml and Sc01_Sheet.xml, 
after that it looks for sprite sheet Sc01_Sheet.png and Sc01_Sheet.plist. If it doesn't succeed it looks for sprites
in single PNGs.

For more information look into code.
